    "## Natural Language Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classifying whole sentences**: Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not\n",
    "- **Classifying each word in a sentence**: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)\n",
    "- **Generating text content**: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words\n",
    "- **Extracting an answer from a text**: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context\n",
    "- **Generating a new sentence from an input text**: Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP isn‚Äôt limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it challenging?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers don‚Äôt process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence ‚ÄúI am hungry,‚Äù we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as ‚ÄúI am hungry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am sad,‚Äù we‚Äôre able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done."

    "\n",
    "- For the same reason, the amount of time and resources needed to get good results are much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one could leverage a pretrained model trained on the English language and then fine-tune it on an arXiv corpus, resulting in a science/research-based model. The fine-tuning will only require a limited amount of data: the knowledge the pretrained model has acquired is ‚Äútransferred,‚Äù hence the term transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning a model therefore has lower time, data, financial, and environmental costs. It is also quicker and easier to iterate over different fine-tuning schemes, as the training is less constraining than a full pretraining.\n",

    "This process will also achieve better results than training from scratch (unless you have lots of data), which is why you should always try to leverage a pretrained model ‚Äî one as close as possible to the task you have at hand ‚Äî and fine-tune it."

    "## **Attention layers** \n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of Transformer models is that they are built with special layers called attention layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this into context, consider the task of translating text from English to French. Given the input ‚ÄúYou like this course‚Äù, a translation model will need to also attend to the adjacent word ‚ÄúYou‚Äù to get the proper translation for the word ‚Äúlike‚Äù, because in French the verb ‚Äúlike‚Äù is conjugated differently depending on the subject. T\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same vein, when translating ‚Äúthis‚Äù the model will also need to pay attention to the word ‚Äúcourse‚Äù, because ‚Äúthis‚Äù translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to any task associated with natural language: a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an idea of what attention layers are all about, let‚Äôs take a closer look at the Transformer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The original architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!). For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Architecture of a Transformers models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the the first attention layer in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the second attention layer uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mask can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words ‚Äî for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Architectures vs. checkpoints** \n",
    "\n",
    "As we dive into Transformer models in this course, you‚Äôll see mentions of architectures and checkpoints as well as models. These terms all have slightly different meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**: This is the skeleton of the model ‚Äî the definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.\n",
    "- **Checkpoints**: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.\n",
    "- **Model**: This is an umbrella term that isn‚Äôt as precise as ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù or ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù: it can mean both. This course will specify architecture or checkpoint when it matters to reduce ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, BERT is an architecture while bert-base-cased, a set of weights trained by the Google team for the first release of BERT, is a checkpoint. However, one can say ‚Äúthe BERT model‚Äù and ‚Äúthe bert-base-cased model.‚Äù"
